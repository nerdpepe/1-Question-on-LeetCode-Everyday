# ᒪEETᑕOᗪE EᐯEᖇYᗪᗩY ✌🏻 

I didn't know about LeetCode during my college day. Hackerrank looked boring. CodeChef seemed too scary.

I was much more comfortable dealing with enemies in _Call of Duty_ 🪖

---

## 🥷 ᗷETTEᖇ ᒪᗩTE Tᕼᗩᑎ ᑎEᐯEᖇ 

I quit my job in Siemens. The time-off, gave me the opportunity to rethink and rework on my weak areas. I know try to do at least one problem everyday.

> I did try doing more than that but it kinda pisses me off 🤷‍♂️ and I might leave it. One is apt for now. 


## ⏰ ᑭᖇOGᖇEᔕᔕ 

Most of the times, there are multiple ways of solving a coding problem, hence I will also keep a track of the questions date wise here.

With the help of a neat table below, I will also keep a status on each problem.

🟢 : All done, doesn't need any change at all

🟡 : Needs modification, or another approach present

🟣 : Need to study and do more pratice
